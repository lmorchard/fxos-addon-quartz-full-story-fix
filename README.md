fxos-addon-quartz-full-story-fix
--------------------------------

I like reading articles on Quartz (qz.com). But, on mobile, stories are usually
partly obscured by additional suggested content with a 'Read full story' button
that should reveal the rest of the article. However, on FxOS, the reveal does
not extend far enough to uncover longer articles.

This add-on reveals the whole article on load automatically and disables the
'Read full story' button altogether.

fxos-addon-messages-tweaks
--------------------------

I had a few annoyances with using the Messages app on Firefox OS. This addon
does the following things:

* Return key sends the current message - because I want to send messages more
  often than I want to include blank lines

* Send and attachment buttons are slightly bigger - because every time I tried
  to tap either of them, I missed, causing the input field to lose focus and
  hiding the keyboard

* Font size of messages is slightly smaller - because I have a nice screen on
  this phone and want to see more messages at once.

TODO:

* Settings to change message font size, enable / disable send-on-return
